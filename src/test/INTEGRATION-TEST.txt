Product: Integration tests for WSO2 ESB Concur connector
    Pre-requisites:

    - Maven 3.x
    - Java 1.6 or above
 - The org.wso2.esb.integration.integration-base project is required. The test suite has been configured to download this project automatically. If the automatic download fails, download the following project and compile it using the mvn clean install command to update your local repository:
      https://github.com/wso2-extensions/esb-integration-base

    Tested Platforms:

    - Microsoft WINDOWS V-7
    - Ubuntu 16.04
    - Mac OSx 10.9
    - WSO2 ESB 5.0.0

Note:
	This test suite can execute based on two scenarios.
		1. Use the given test account and parameters at the end of the file. - in this scenario you only need to replace access Token in property file
		2. Setup new concur account and follow all the instruction given below in step 5.

Steps to follow in setting integration test.
 1.  Download ESB 5.0.0 from official site.

 2.  Navigate to location "/wso2esb-5.0.0-BETA/repository/conf/axis2" and add/uncomment following lines in "axis2.xml" and Message Formatters and Message Builders should be added for each of the content types of the files to be added as attachments.

		Message Formatters :-

        <messageFormatter contentType="image/gif" class="org.wso2.carbon.relay.ExpandingMessageFormatter"/>
        <messageFormatter contentType="img/gif" class="org.wso2.carbon.relay.ExpandingMessageFormatter"/>
        <messageFormatter contentType="image/jpeg" class="org.wso2.carbon.relay.ExpandingMessageFormatter"/>
        <messageFormatter contentType="image/png" class="org.wso2.carbon.relay.ExpandingMessageFormatter"/>

		Message Builders :-

		<messageBuilder contentType="image/gif" class="org.wso2.carbon.relay.BinaryRelayBuilder"/>
        <messageBuilder contentType="img/gif" class="org.wso2.carbon.relay.BinaryRelayBuilder"/>
        <messageBuilder contentType="image/jpeg" class="org.wso2.carbon.relay.BinaryRelayBuilder"/>
        <messageBuilder contentType="image/png" class="org.wso2.carbon.relay.BinaryRelayBuilder"/>

 3.  Compress modified ESB as wso2esb-5.0.0.zip and copy that zip file in to location "<CONCUR_CONNECTORS_HOME>/repository/".
